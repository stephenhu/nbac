# backlog

* print meaningful output for events like file written
* file overwrite
* defect: uses local time instead of est or pst
* gameTime is returning empty
* nbac status when no schedule.json
* schedule.json seems to get checked with any command
* current resume download is broken, it is based on dir being available, but the dir could be empty or partially full?
* resume should be based on status, status should provide a diff of missing files and that's what should be downloaded
* ~~resume sync~~
* ~~file check~~
